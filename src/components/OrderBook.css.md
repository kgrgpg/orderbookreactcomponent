# OrderBook.css

## Purpose
This CSS file contains the styling for the `OrderBook` component. It includes styles for the order book container, table, rows, and bars.

## Key Decisions
- **Color Coding:** Different colors for asks and bids to visually differentiate them.
- **Hover Effects:** Added hover effects to highlight rows.
- **Bar Representation:** The width of the bar represents the cumulative quantity.

## Challenges
- **Consistent Styling:** Ensuring the styles are consistent and work well with dynamic data.
- **Responsiveness:** Making sure the component looks good on different screen sizes.

## Code Explanation
- **`.order-book-container`:** Styles the main container of the order book.
- **`.order-book-single-column`:** Styles the table that contains the order book data.
- **`.asks` and `.bids`:** Different background colors for asks and bids.
- **`.spread-row`:** Styles the row that shows the spread between the best ask and bid prices.
- **`.bar`:** Styles for the bars that represent the cumulative quantities.

## Future Improvements
- **Theme Support:** Add support for different themes (dark mode, light mode).
- **Animations:** Add animations for smoother transitions when data updates.
